# GRADREC

## DESCRIPTION

GRADREC (Graduate Recruitment) is a web-based system that enables faculty members to advertise Master/PhD positions, provide information about their research projects and the availability of financial aid.  Our goal is to become a world leader at connecting high skilled researchers with highly motivated students to create next generation projects and research.

Disclaimer: This was a class project for the Software Engineering course for graduate students at Memorial University of Newfoundland. We used NodeJS and MongoDB for the back-end, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. 

## INITIAL SETUP

1. Install *npm* and *nodejs*

2. Open the **terminal** in the project home directory.

3. Clone the repository with the command **_git clone https://github.com/rubencg195/GRADREC_**

4. enter the new created folder called **GRADREC**

5. Run the following command **_npm install_**
